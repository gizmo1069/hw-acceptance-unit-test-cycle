They may say that there is a problem with your account and that you need to provide them with your personal information or credit card number to fix it. Embassy/citizenship scams: The scammer will call you and claim to be from your Embassy or US Homeland Security. They may say your personal information is being used to commit crimes and there is a warrant in your name. You will be asked to open a video app and remain monitored on video to prove your innocence. You may also be asked to pay large sums of money for a “bail bond” with the promise it will be returned later. In these cases, you will be asked to send more and more money until you realize it’s a scam and communication is ended. Tech support / financial institute scams: The scammer will call you and claim to be from a company. They will say that there is a problem with your computer or account and that you need to give them remote access to fix it.

You should also keep a record of all the information you have about the scam, including the phone number, email address, and website address. \n  If you are not sure if an email is a scam or real, you can take a screenshot and send it to CS Advising to verify. Never forward suspicious emails!!\n  If you have any questions or concerns about phishing scams or suspicious emails, do not hesitate to reach out to CUIT, CRF, Public Safety, or CS Advising."], ["author", "Columbia CS Advising"], ["published_at", "2023-11-14"], ["created_at", "2023-11-15 08:03:25.135527"], ["updated_at", "2023-11-15 08:03:25.135527"]]

You should also keep a record of all the information you have about the scam, including the phone number, email address, and website address. \n  If you are not sure if an email is a scam or real, you can take a screenshot and send it to CS Advising to verify. Never forward suspicious emails!!\n  If you have any questions or concerns about phishing scams or suspicious emails, do not hesitate to reach out to CUIT, CRF, Public Safety, or CS Advising."], ["author", "Columbia CS Advising"], ["published_at", "2023-11-14"], ["created_at", "2023-11-15 09:05:01.975857"], ["updated_at", "2023-11-15 09:05:01.975857"]]
